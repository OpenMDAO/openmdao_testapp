This is a webapp to manage automated testing of the OpenMDAO-Framework 
repository.

Everything is driven by a config file called testing.cfg.  
A testing.cfg.example file can be found in the repo.  You can use this
as a starting point.

You must run this from within an active OpenMDAO development environment, 
so build the OpenMDAO environment, then install this package. Typically
you would do this by cd'ing to the openmdao_testapp repo after activating
the openmdao environment and doing a 'python setup.py develop' from there.

To build a new testing database, do the following:

  python create_db.py

The startserver and restartserver scripts will redirect server stdout/stderr
to a server.log file.
